LXT Math Library
================

LXT math is an include-only C library for SIMD-accelerated small matrix (4x4) computation. It is suitable for games, graphics and embedded projects. LXT math does not support general linear algebra operations, or NxN matrices. A C++ interface is given as a suggested wrapper, but it is not necessary for using the library. 

LXT math is under the MIT license and is free to use and modify in your projects. Acknowledgements are welcome.

Intel SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, AVX
ARM NEON
PowerPC AltiVec, VMX

Supported Compilers:
gcc, icc, clang, Visual C++
