LXT Math Library
================

LXT math is a C library for SIMD-accelerated small matrix (4x4) computation. It is suitable for games, graphics and embedded projects.

LXT does not support general linear algebra operations, or NxN matrices. A C++ interface is given as a suggested wrapper, but it is not necessary for using the library. 

LXT is free to use and modify in your projects, under the MIT license. Acknowledgements are welcome.

Supported Architectures:
Intel SSE2, SSE3, SSE4, AVX
ARM NEON
PowerPC AltiVec, VMX

Supported Compilers:
gcc, icc, clang, Visual C++

Supported Operating Systems:
Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
